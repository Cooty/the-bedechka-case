# Entrypoints

Add TypeScript (`.ts`) files here that are meant to generate a single entrypoint to a page, so they create a separate bundle to be loaded from an HTML template.

Add these to Webpack Encore in `~/webpack.config.js` as an `addEntry()` call.

For further info see the documentation on [Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/simple-example.html).
