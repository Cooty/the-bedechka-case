# Base styles

**IMPORTANT!**
This is deprecated: Move all "modular styles" to the respective folder in `templates/componets`.
The plan is to have all frontend files next to the twig files from where they are served.

The styles in this folder are responsible for global settings, that are inherited mostly for generic elements (eg. link styles, user agent styles reset).
