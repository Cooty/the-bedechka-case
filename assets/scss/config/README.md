# Preprocessor configs

**IMPORTANT!**
This is deprecated: Move all "modular styles" to the respective folder in `templates/componets`.
The plan is to have all frontend files next to the twig files from where they are served.

Files in this folder don't emmit styles on their own, they all relate to SASS CSS preprocessor.
They are either variables or functions, mixins, etc that are meant to be reused in any (partial) stylesheet.
