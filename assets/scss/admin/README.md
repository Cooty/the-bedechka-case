# Admin styles

**IMPORTANT!**
This is deprecated: Move all "modular styles" to the respective folder in `templates/componets`.
The plan is to have all frontend files next to the twig files from where they are served.

These styles are only meant to be used on the `/admin` pages of the site.
Most of the admin is based on [Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com/) (which is installed from NPM, see `package.json`) components, so most of these files are overwrites or extensions of the framework.
