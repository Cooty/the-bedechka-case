# Styles for layout

**IMPORTANT!**
This is deprecated: Move all "modular styles" to the respective folder in `templates/componets`.
The plan is to have all frontend files next to the twig files from where they are served.

These files are all used to make layout specific styles.
They are either part of the core-design or they are strongly coupled with the content being displayed.

They are **not** meant to be be reusable and will only appear once per screen (or they are present on all screens).
